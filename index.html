<p>FarmingBot is a simple application that enables you to let your computer do the boring part of gaming for you. 
If you're playing a game where you can repeat quests or missions to earn gems or credits, just simply let the computer repeat it overnight and you'll be rich the next morning!</p>

<p>This is the first project that I am hosting on GitHub, although I programmed this application last year (2012). Please do comment and give me suggestions. 
I am going to add a feature so that you can record the routines by actually doing them, instead of writing the code. </p>

<p><img src="README/Screenshot.png" alt="Application screenshot"></p>

<p>This shows the application's main window. </p>

<h2>
<a name="installing" class="anchor" href="#installing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing</h2>

<p>Please note that this application was programmed in Visual Basic and therefore only works on the Windows operating system. </p>

<h3>
<a name="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h3>

<p>If you want to do a full setup (install it on your computer) open <a href="FarmingBot/publish/">FarmingBot/publish/</a> and execute <a href="FarmingBot/publish/setup.exe">setup.exe</a>. This will correctly install it on your machine. </p>

<h3>
<a name="just-to-try" class="anchor" href="#just-to-try"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Just to try</h3>

<p>If you do not want a full installation and just want to test it, navigate to <a href="FarmingBot/publish/Application%20Files">FarmingBot/publish/Application Files</a> and open the latest version of FarmingBot. Then, execute FarmingBot.exe. Have fun!</p>

<h3>
<a name="problems" class="anchor" href="#problems"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problems</h3>

<p>If you are encountering problems during the installation, it's probably because you did not download the whole <a href="FarmingBot/publish/">publish</a> folder. The <a href="FarmingBot/publish/setup.exe">setup.exe</a> file has to be able to access the <a href="FarmingBot/publish/Application%20Files">Application Files</a> folder. </p>

<p>Another problem might be that you cannot start the application. If this is the case, make sure that the DLL <a href="FarmingBot/Main.dll">Main.dll</a> is located in the same directory as FarmingBot.exe. </p>

<a name="programming-routines" class="anchor" href="#programming-routines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming routines</h2>

<p>In order to create a routine that the computer should execute, you have to do a little coding, which is actually quite simple. For starters, press "Generate Sample Data" and look at the files. The commands are fairly self-explanatory. 
If you need more help, view the <a href="../../wiki/FarmingBot-Programming-Language">FarmingBot programming language documentation</a>. </p>
