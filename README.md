FarmingBot
==========
FarmingBot is a simple application that enables you to let your computer do gaming for you. 
If you are playing a game, where you can repeat quests or missions to earn gems or credits, just simply let the computer repeat it overnight and you'll be rich!
It is actually quite simple to program the routines. For starters, press "Generate Sample Data" and look at the files. The commands are simple and self-explanatory. 

This is my first project that I am hosting on GitHub, although I programmed this application last year (2012). Please do comment and give me suggestions. 
I am going to add a feature so that you can record the routines by actually doing them, instead of writing the code.
